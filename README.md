## Prereqs

In order to have a running API server with FastAPI, you're going to need to install [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and a package that runs a server for you. This is here [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) comes in. 

Install:
- 'pip install fastapi[all]'   <---- This installs fastAPI, uvicorn and all dependencies. 

>NOTE: FastAPI relies on pydantic for all the validation and definitions of objects.
